# Deep Segmentation Features for Weakly Supervised Disease Classification via 3D Dual-Stage CNN 

**Problem Statement**: Weakly supervised 3D classification of multi-organ, multi-disease CT scans. 

**Data** (*proprietary to Duke University Medical Center*): 1054 Diseased Lungs Cases (286 Pneumonia-Atelectasis, 279 Emphysema, 246 Nodules, 243 Mass); 577 Healthy Lungs Cases. 

**Note**: The following repository currently serves as an archive. It is functional, but requires a full cleanup and directory setup. All updates to the implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/fitushar/WeaklySupervised-3D-Classification-of-Chest-CT-using-Aggregated-MultiResolution-Segmentation-Feature).

## Network Architecture  
  
  
![Network Architecture](reports/images/network_architecture.png)*Figure 1.  Integrated model architecture for reusing segmentation feature maps in 3D binary classification. The segmentation sub-model is a DenseVNet, taking a variable input volume with a single channel and the classification sub-model is a 3D ResNet, taking an input volume patch of size [112,112,112] with 2 channels. Final output is a tensor with the predicted class probabilities.*
